## Example Test

You can use postman collection in the source code (DemoBank.postman_collection.json)

Step 1: Create Customer 

```bash
curl --location 'localhost:8081/customer' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "Ali Din√ßer",
    "surName": "Dere"
}'
```

get the customer id GUID in response and use it in the below request:

Step 2: Create Account

```bash
curl --location 'localhost:8081/account' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "customerId":"1f1ae2a9-caac-4ed7-aad0-683ef8191616",
    "initialCredit":"10"
}'
```

Step 3: Get Customer

use the same customer id again in this request

```bash
curl --location 'localhost:8081/customer/1f1ae2a9-caac-4ed7-aad0-683ef8191616'
```

Step 4: Create New Transaction

below use the account id which you can see in above request

```bash
curl --location 'localhost:8082/transaction/process' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "amount":15,
    "transactionType":"DEPOSIT",
    "accountId":"b0b710fe-0d72-4776-8852-83651f39b162"
}'
```

you can also try with transaction type "WITHDRAW" as well.
After doing several DEPOSIT and WITHDRAW operations you can apply STEP 3 to see transaction list and customer.

if you apply withdraw more than the account amount you can see insufficient funds error as well.

## Architecture
